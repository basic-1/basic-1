# samples directory  
  
## Brief  
  
The directory contains example programs written in BASIC. Some of the examples should be compatible with other popular BASIC dialects and others use features specific to BASIC1.  
  
## Samples  
  
- 1.bsc - the simplest numeric array sorting (selection sort algorithm)  
- 2.bsc - the same as 1.bsc but sorting text strings  
- 3.bsc - quadratic equation solver ("classic" BASIC dialect)  
- 4.bsc - quadratic equation solver (using some BASIC1-specific features)  
- 5.bsc - solve a system of linear equations (Gaussian elimination algorithm)  
- 6.bsc - "Xs and Os" simple game ("Tic-tac-toe")
